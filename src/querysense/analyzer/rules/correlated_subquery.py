"""
Rule: Correlated Subquery (Inefficient SubPlan)

Detects correlated subqueries that execute once per outer row,
causing O(n*m) performance when a JOIN would be O(n+m).

Why it matters:
- SubPlan nodes with loops = outer row count execute the subquery repeatedly
- A 10K row outer table with a subquery = 10K subquery executions
- JOINs, CTEs, or LATERAL can often achieve the same result more efficiently

When it's okay:
- Very small outer result sets (< 100 rows)
- Subquery is extremely cheap (index lookup returning 1 row)
- EXISTS/NOT EXISTS with proper indexing (can be optimized)
